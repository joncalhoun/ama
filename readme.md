I saw this idea on wesbos/ama and really like the idea so I forked it. The idea is pretty simply - if you have a question you'd like to ask me, ask it here and I can share the answer with everyone.

Anything means _anything_ - Personal questions. Making and spending money. Work. Life. Coding. Workflow. Setups.

I'm an independent fullstack developer primarily writing Go and Ruby on Rails. I teach, speak and write all things code. 

I'm [@joncalhoun](https://twitter.com/joncalhoun) on twitter, and I blog at [calhoun.io](https://www.calhoun.io). 

I'm the author of [Web Development with Go](https://www.usegolang.com) which is in early access, but is still being used by hundreds of developers to learn how to build real, production-grade web applications in Go.

I also produce a free video/text series teaching algorithms - [Let's Learn Algorithms](https://www.calhoun.io/lets-learn-algorithms/) and plan to release a few more free courses over the summer.
